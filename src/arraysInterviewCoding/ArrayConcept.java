 * stack is also a linear data structure ...arrays store only sim ilar type of data synatx of creating a n array
 * int arr[] =new int[5]; --> arr[] is referene variable new int[5] is my array and the size of array is 5 this is int 
 * type of array ( we will get 5 consectutive memory location )
 * Datatype how much memory will be required to store the data int byte short long...double 
 * Arrays are always created in heap memory refrence variable can be created in static 
 *  Arrays are always my fixed size array size can be changed arrays are always initiziled with initial value 0
 *  reference variable always store memory address of an array  or object 777 memory is the cumalitive memory add
